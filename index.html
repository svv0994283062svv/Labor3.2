    <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Computer programming </span>is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. <span  style="font-weight: bold;">Programming </span> <br> 
        involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen<br>  programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more  The purpose of programming is to find <br>a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance  of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often<br> requires expertise in several different  subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

<h3 id="History">History</h3>
<div style="border-top: 1px solid gray; margin-bottom: 10px ;"></div>
<p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms <br> and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves  by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes <br> punched in them.</p>
<p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli <br> numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid <br> 1960s. </p>
<p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator <br> allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels <br> in a similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data <br> were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer <br>
</p>
<p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon <br> developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for <br> specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different  notation for a machine language, any two machines with different<br>instruction sets also have different assembly languages. Kathleen Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at Birkbeck <br> College.

<h4 id="Quality">Quality requirements</h4>
<p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most <br> important:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, <br> such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors  (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors). <br></li>
    <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, <br> unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages. <br></li>
    <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated <br> purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware <br> elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface. <br></li>
    <li>Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This <br> depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected <br> behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code. <br></li>
    <li>Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix bugs <br> and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good practices[24] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be <br> directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term. <br></li>
    <li>Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and <br> to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and <br> eliminating memory leaks.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Readability">Readability of source code</h4>
<p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It <br> affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.</p>
<p>Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing <br> new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[25] found that a few simple readability transformations made <br> code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.
</p>
<h4 id="Algorithmic">Algorithmic complexity</h4>
<p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient <br> algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as <br> execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their <br> respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.
</p>
<h5 id="Chess">Chess algorithms as an example</h5>
<p>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part of the history of algorithmic complexity; a course <br> on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is part of the computer science curriculum at Stanford University.[27]
</p>
<h3 id="Programming  languages">Programming languages</h3>
<div style="border-top: 1px solid gray; margin-bottom: 10px ;"></div>
<p>Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject to many <br> considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best <br> suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of <br> compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" <br> to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use <br> but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.
